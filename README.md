Volume EM data from [Integrative imaging reveals SARS-CoV-2-induced reshaping of subcellular morphologies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193131282030620X).

## Opening the project in MoBIE

In order to load one of the data-sets in MoBIE, you need to [install the MoBIE Fiji Plugin](https://github.com/mobie/mobie-viewer-fiji#install).
You can then open the project via:
- `Plugins->MoBIE->Open->Open Published MoBIE Project` and select `Cortese et al. (2020) Covid FIB-SEM, Cell Host & Microbe`.
- `Plugins->MoBIE->Open->Open MoBIE Project` and enter https://github.com/mobie/covid-em-project.
- or, to load the local copy of the data on premise at EMBL, enter `/g/emcf/common/5792_Sars-Cov-2/covid-em/data` instead.

## Set-up

I have set up a conda environment with all necessary dependencies in `software/miniconda`.
You can activate it by running:
```shell
source software/run_conda.sh
conda activate covid-em-dev
```


## Usage

Use the `stack_to_mmb_format.py` script to convert a folder with tiff slices into the MMB format:
```shell
python stack_to_mmb_format.py /path/to/folder/with/tiffs name
```
